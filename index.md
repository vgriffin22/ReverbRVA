Once the capital of the confederacy, Richmond, Virginia, is a historical city, but it’s definitely not stuck in the past. 
 
The site of Patrick Henry’s “Give me liberty or give me death speech” in 1775, Richmond was also voted one of the “10 Coolest US Cities to Visit in 2018” by Forbes.com. The home of trail-blazing African-Americans—including Maggie Walker, Bill “Bojangles” Robinson and Arthur Ashe, Richmond was also recently named the #1 beer destination in the world by VinePair.


But Richmond isn’t just a great place to visit; it’s a wonderful place to live. Learn more about the River City’s charming, historic neighborhoods by clicking on each link below
